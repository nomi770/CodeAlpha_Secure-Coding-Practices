Explanation:

User input is validated and sanitized.
Password hashing is employed.
Error handling is implemented to avoid sensitive information disclosure.
Remember: This is a simplified example. Secure coding practices are an ongoing process, and constant vigilance is necessary to stay ahead of evolving threats.

Manual Code Review and Additional Considerations:

Conduct manual code reviews alongside static code analysis for a more comprehensive assessment.
Stay updated on security vulnerabilities and best practices for your chosen language and frameworks.
Consider security testing tools to simulate attacks and identify potential weaknesses.
By following these guidelines and continuously improving your security awareness, you can build more secure applications that protect user data and system integrity
